Smoke Testing: 
 - Quick health check of core features
Sanity Testing: 
 - Checks if specific changes work without full retesting

 Regression Testing: 
 - Ensures new features don't break existing ones
 - Comprehensive check of all functionalities
 - Example: Retesting login, search, etc., after adding a new feature

 Retesting:
 - Rechecks specific issues after fixes
 - Focused on resolved problems
 - Example: Verifying a form submission works after a bug fix
